	abstract = {Since first identified, the epidemic scale of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China, has increased rapidly, with cases arising across China and other countries and regions. using a transmission model, we estimate a basic reproductive number of 3.11 (95\%CI, 2.39-4.13); 58-76\% of transmissions must be prevented to stop increasing; Wuhan case ascertainment of 5.0\% (3.6-7.4); 21022 (11090-33490) total infections in Wuhan 1 to 22 January.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementJMR and CPJ acknowledge support from the Medical Research Council (MR/5004793/1).
